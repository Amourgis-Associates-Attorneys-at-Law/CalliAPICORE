    <h4>About CalliAPI</h4>
    <p>
        In Greek mythology, the Muses were divine figures who inspired the creation of literature, science, and the arts — the very root of the word <em>music</em> comes from <em>mousikē</em>, meaning “the art of the Muses.”
        <br /><br />
        While <strong>Clio</strong>, the Muse of history, lends her name to the Clio matter management platform, <strong>Calliope</strong> (pronounced <em>kuh-LIE-uh-pee</em>) was revered as the Muse of eloquence and epic poetry — often called the <strong>Chief of all Muses</strong>.
        <br /><br />
        It is in that spirit that <strong>CalliAPI</strong> was named: a tool designed to <strong>gather information from</strong>, <strong>guide</strong>, and <strong>enhance</strong> the work done in Clio. As an API (Application Programming Interface), CalliAPI acts as a bridge — connecting systems, streamlining workflows, and helping your data speak more clearly.

  <hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">
</details>


<h2>5.0 - Prep for Azure Launch! </h2>
- Add a MainForm indicator for whether the app is running in Portable or Installed mode, which will help us determine how to handle updates and functionality 
in the future.
- Adde a logTextBox so that the console isn't needed.
- Update AmourgisCOREServices from 2.3.0 to 2.5.0, which includes more sinks and the ability to subscribe to a LogMessage event so we can display user-facing logs.
- Add singleton dependency injection for the LogService, which will allow us to easily log messages throughout the application without needing to create new instances
of the LogService every time.
- Removed the TreeListView report selector, as the custom reports are an ideal replacement. This simplifies the UI and makes it less overwhelming for new users.
- Add DependencyInjection so we can optimize the codebase and make it easier to manage dependencies. This will help us maintain a cleaner and more modular code structure, 
making it easier to add new features in the future, as well as preventing unexpected behavior.
- Add registry secrets to the Dependency Injection container, which will allow us to securely store and access sensitive information like API keys and tokens. 
This is a crucial step in ensuring the security and reliability of the application, as well as making it much more user friendly.
- Fixed the issue where the entire program self-minimized when a report was running.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<details><summary><strong>CalliAPI 4</strong> (June 2025)</summary>
<h3>4.8 - Report Form Functionality Improvements! </h3>
- Added a checkedListBox to allow users to select which fields they want to include in the report, making it easier to customize the report output.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.7.6 - Updates to Reporting Functionality! </h4>
- Added a button to make it clearer how to use the Custom Report Builder, which will help users understand how to generate reports more easily.
- Add a call to VerifyAPI() when the Custom Report Builder is opened, to ensure that the API is available before attempting to generate reports. This will help prevent 
errors and ensure a smoother user experience!
- Added "All" and "Clear" buttons to the Matter fields and Client fields checkboxes
- Defaulted the Matter and Client checkboxes so that useful information is included in the report by default, such as Client Name, Matter Name, and Matter Stage Name.
- Changed the order of the columns in the ReportForm so that the most useful information is displayed first, making it easier for users to read and understand the reports.
- Added code to allow for duplicate field names by incrementing the field name if a duplicate is found. This will help prevent errors and ensure that all fields are included 
in the report, even if they have the same name.
- Fixed an emergent breaking issue where the ReportForm would exceed FillWeightLimit and not display anything.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.7.5 - Fix Collision Bug in Report Form </h4>
- Fix the way that some fields with the same display name were being mixed in the ReportForm (such as client{name} and matter_stage{name} and practice_area{name}).
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.7.4 - Quality of Life Changes</h4>
- Allow users to "skip Github token check in the future"
- Rewrote the splash logic to only run the update checker if on an installed instance with a Github token, so as to prevent Unauthorized errors for users without a 
Github token
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.7.3 - Small Improvements</h4>
- Added more detail and an About section to the install page. 
- Updated the AboutForm to include more useful information.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.7.2 - Quick Bug Fix</h4>
- Fixed the issue that disabled the Custom Report Builder in 4.7.1! Should be good to go now!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.7.1 - Store Clio Access and Refresh Tokens!</h4>
- We now have the ability to actually store the refresh and access tokens to the user's registry, meaning that CalliAPI should no longer prompt for the OAuth flow
every single time we run her.
- Add "matter_stage_updated_at" to the Matter model.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>4.7.0 - Velopack Now Allows for Zip file runs!</h3>
- By checking to make sure we're not running from AppData or ProgramFiles, CalliAPI 4.7.0+ is smart enough to recognize the app isn't installed, and if it's not installed 
it'll just skip calling Velopack at all! That means, if you have CalliAPI installed, she'll check for updates, but if you don't, she won't even try - making the portable 
version truly portable!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>4.6.0 - GitHub Authentication Added</h3>
- Added matter_stage to the selectable items in the Custom Report Builder!
- Added authentication via GitHub token
- Created a RegistrySecretManager class to handle secrets on the user side and prevent access issues or security issues
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">


<h4>4.5.3 - Bug Fixes & Improvements</h4>
- Made the ReadMe more readable and added a control to allow users to collapse the install instructions, rather than having to scroll past them to read the changes.
- Updated AmourgisCOREServices to 2.3.0, updated Velopack.
- Added badges to index.html to display the integrations available.
- Removed MaterialSkin due to deprecation warnings.
- Fixed a bug that would cause clicking the Clio API Documentation link to crash the program.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">


<h4>4.5.2 - ReadMe Updates Continued</h4>
- Added horizontal rules and summary tags to the ReadMe to improve readability and organization. This will help users quickly navigate through the different sections of the 
documentation and find the information they need.
- Updated the PowerShell script to push updates to be more modular, reliable, and easy to maintain.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.5.1 - ReadMe Revamp and Documentation Improvements!</h4>
- Revamped the ReadMe to make it more user-friendly and easier to navigate. This will help users quickly find the information they need about CalliAPI and its features.
This update also includes HTML header tags to improve the structure and readability of the documentation and the install Page, making it more accessible for users and 
developers alike.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>4.5 - Major Refactoring, Bug Fixes, and Improvements!</h3>
- Simplified "using" statements throughout the codebase to improve readability and maintainability. This change will help streamline the code and make it easier to understand
and modify in the future.
- Updated DLL Import in Main to use LibraryImport instead, which is a more modern and efficient way to handle DLL imports in .NET. This change will improve performance 
and reduce potential issues related to DLL loading.
- Simplified collection initialization in the codebase to enhance performance and reduce memory overhead. This change will help optimize the application's performance, 
especially when dealing with large datasets or collections.
- Removed the Reports MenuStrip item to ensure that the Custom Report Builder is the primary way to generate reports. This change will help streamline the user experience and 
focus on the Custom Report Builder as the main reporting tool.
- Added a new "About" menu item to the Help MenuStrip, providing users with information about the application, its version, and how to get support. This will enhance the user 
experience by making it easier to find help and information about CalliAPI.
- Added plenty of new comments throughout the codebase to improve documentation and make it easier for developers to understand the code. This change will help future 
developers quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code, making maintenance and updates easier.
- Added XML documentation to the codebase to provide detailed explanations of classes, methods, and properties. This will enhance the overall documentation quality and make 
it easier for developers to understand how to use and extend the application.
- Simplified the initialization of variables throughout the codebase to improve readability and maintainability. This change will help make the code cleaner and easier to 
understand, reducing potential confusion for developers working on the project, and aligns with best practices.
- Removed multiple unneeded functions and variables from the codebase to streamline the application and improve performance. This change will help reduce complexity and make 
the codebase cleaner and more efficient.
- Consolidated the ClioService in order to simplify the codebase and improve maintainability. This change will help reduce redundancy and make it easier to manage the 
ClioService functionality, ensuring that all related code is in one place.
- Renamed multiple controls to use PascalCase, which is a common naming convention in C#. This change will improve code consistency and readability, making it easier for 
developers to understand the purpose of different controls and components.
- Added XML documentation to the Models in the codebase to provide detailed explanations of the data structures used in the application. This will enhance the overall 
documentation quality and make it easier for developers to understand how to use and extend the Models.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.4.2 - Minor Improvements</h4>
- Added new fonts to the program, making it more visually appealing and easier to read.
- Added FRC and All Practice Area buttons to the Custom Report Builder, allowing users to quickly generate reports for specific practice areas.
- Rearranged the Custom Report Builder form to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.4.1 - Added a Second Progress Bar for Spinning Up!</h4>
- Now we can see the progress that CalliAPI makes in the spin-up phase (where she checks how many pages to expect), which gives us more reliable UI indication and prevents 
surprises.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>4.4 - Cleaned Custom Report Builder Form, Updated UI, and Added New Filters!</h3>
- Finally fixed the progress bar in the Custom Report Builder Form to provide an accurate estimate of page count before it begins to update. Now it won't be a surprise how 
long the program takes to complete a report or how many pages are needed! All of the 4.3 bug fixes are included as well for a polished 4.4!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.3.4 - Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
- Added filtering by no active tasks in the Custom Report Builder! This enhancement allows users to filter reports based on whether there are active tasks associated with 
matters, making it easier to identify matters that may require attention or follow-up.

<h4>4.3.3 - Added ability to filter by Practice Area in Custom Report Builder!</h4>
This will save so much time in execution, especially as our dataset scales up! The ability to filter by Practice Area in the Custom Report Builder is a significant 
enhancement that will allow users to generate more targeted and relevant reports based on their specific practice areas. This feature will greatly improve the usability of the report 
builder and make it easier to analyze data related to different practice areas.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.3.2 - Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
- Added the ability to search for SQL Views in the Custom Report Builder! This enhancement allows users to filter and generate reports based on specific views, making it 
easier to analyze data in a more structured way.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.3.1 - Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
- Added parallelization to the Unworked 713 Search! Should help greatly increase the speed of the search.
- Updated the retryAfter Policy to include longer delays to allow for more respect from the Clio API.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>4.3 - Bug Fixes and Improvements</h3>
Finally fixed the auto-update bug that arose in 4.2.2! This should resolve any issues users were experiencing with the auto-update feature, ensuring a smoother update process. 
Additionally, we have made some improvements to the overall performance and stability of the application.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.2.2 - Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
- Removed extra logging in the Release version, to allow for better performance and cleaner logs. This should improve the overall user experience by reducing unnecessary log 
clutter and focusing on essential information.
- The logs are still visible when run in Debug mode, allowing developers to troubleshoot and monitor the application effectively during development.
- Attempting to fix an auto-update bug that caused the application to crash when trying to update. This should resolve any issues users were experiencing with the auto-update 
feature, ensuring a smoother update process.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.2.1 - Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
- Error handling for the ReportForm when the xlsx file is already locked has been added. This will prevent crashes and ensure that users can handle file access issues 
gracefully.
- The 7 & 13 custom report was not working properly, so it has been fixed. This should resolve any issues users were experiencing with this specific report.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>4.2 - Reporting Updates!</h3>
Custom Fields now appear in alphabetical order on the ReportForm, to make it easier to filter. We also have individual filters for each column! This will greatly improve the
usability of the report builder and make it easier to generate reports tailored to specific needs. 
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>4.1 - Custom Report Builder Enhancements and Bug Fixes</h3>
We finally have friendly names for the Custom Fields in Clio!!! This means that when you use the custom report builder, the custom fields will now display their friendly names 
instead of their IDs, making it much easier to understand and use the report builder effectively. This enhancement significantly improves the usability of the custom report 
builder and makes it easier to generate reports tailored to specific needs.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>4.0.1 - Bug Fixes</h4>
Pointed the CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET to the proper place, so now the custom report builder should work properly with Clio queries!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h2>4.0 - Custom Report Builder Enhancements and Bug Fixes; SQL Support!!!</h2>
We can now see into our SQL server with the custom report builder! This is a huge step forward in making CalliAPI more versatile and powerful. The custom report builder now 
supports SQL queries, allowing users to generate reports based on SQL data directly within the application. This enhancement will significantly improve the usability of the
report builder and make it easier to generate reports tailored to specific needs.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>CalliAPI 3</strong> (May 2025)</summary>
<h3>3.2.1 - Splash Screen!</h3>
Also checks for updates on startup, so you can always be sure you're running the latest version of CalliAPI!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>3.1.2 - Added custom fields to custom report builder!</h4>
Also, finally fixed that really anying flickering progress bar issue (I hope)! The custom report builder now supports custom fields, allowing for more flexibility in report 
generation. This is a significant improvement that will enhance the usability of the report builder and make it easier to generate reports tailored to specific needs!
Finally, this patch also gives us the Page {X} of {Y} label back, which I missed dearly (due to a visual bug)!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>3.1.1 - Small bug fixes</h4>
Fixed the progress bar issue where it was not displaying the percentage correctly. This should now show the correct progress during report generation! Additionally, the 
CreatedSince dateTime picker should function properly in the ReportBuilder!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>3.1 - CUSTOM REPORT BUILDER!!!!</h3>
CalliAPI has a custom report builder now! Adding deserialization into the Matter Parser for extra "nice".
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>3.0.4 - Clio App Fixes</h4>
Added a field for the user to enter their Clio App secret key, allowing for more secure authentication. This change is crucial for ensuring that the CalliAPI can access Clio 
data without exposing sensitive information in the codebase.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>3.0.3 - Custom Field Adds!</h4>
Added 13584798 - Emergency Case Type! Doing this required a large rework to how we process Matters. Actual translation of picklist items will come soon!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>3.0.2 - Added Automatic updates</h4>
From 3.0.2 onwards, CalliAPI should also allow for automatic updates on each run!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h2>3.0 - Restructure AuthService + GitHub Secret Support</h2>
AuthService is now done UNDERNEATH ClioService, and our Client secret is now stored safely in GitHub. The old Clio App client is now DELETED, so the new one is the only one 
that can be used to access CalliAPI. This means there's no risk that attackers will scrounge up the old Client secret, as it is deactivated.
This change is HUGE, as it allows us to securely store our secrets in GitHub, and it also simplifies the authentication process by making it more modular and easier to 
maintain.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>CalliAPI 2</strong> (May 2025)</summary>
<h4>2.1 - Updated download page and implemented auto-update functionality!</h3>
Plus, added raw image storage so we can easily update the logo and other images in the future! This is a big step forward in making CalliAPI more user-friendly and easier to 
maintain. The auto-update functionality will ensure that users always have the latest version without needing to manually download updates.
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h2>2.0 - Finally, automatic hosting on GitHub pages is live!</h2>
CalliAPI is now hosted on GitHub Pages, with a custom index page for easy installation! This is a huge step forward in making CalliAPI accessible to everyone at Amourgis & 
Associates, and it should make future updates much easier to manage!
[x] Wishlist item: Add a zip to the docs folder so that users can fallback on the zip completed!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>CalliAPI 1</strong></summary>
<h3>1.9.5 - UI tweaks and Matter Descriptions!</h3>
Now we can actually cancel the authorization dialog, instead of being stuck in limbo! Also, the Matter Descriptions are now included in the Matter searches, so we can retrieve 
them too!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>1.8.0 - Prepping framework for a new way to install and landing pages!</h3>
Now CalliAPI has a more permanent home inside GitHub Pages with a custom-made index page for installing from!
(Don't ask about 1.5 and 1.6 and 1.7, it was all suffering with MSBuild, but now I know more I suppose!)
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>1.4.0 - Glow up in preparation for version 2!</h3>
A new UI, a new icon, and a new way of installing gives CalliAPI a lot more staying power! Couple that with the new Publish.html page and we have a way more user-friendly 
experience!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>1.3.0 - Added VersionHelper and fixed some bugs!</h3>
Added a VersionHelper to help with maintaining version control. The ClickOnce version should now be the same as the version in the .csproj file, so we should be pretty good to 
go with updates and version control moving forward!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h4>1.2.1 - Centralized version numbering, expanded filters!</h4>
Added display_name to the fields we can parse from Clio into Matters, so now we have our own ideal way of sorting and identifying clients! It also gives us the ability to now 
FILTER by display_name, which is a huge win!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>1.2.0 - Added UI implementation and KEYWORD SUPPORT!!!</h3>
I'm so pleased with this interface! The keyword inclusion is a gamechanger, and I'll continue moving reports into this TreeView UI so as to provide easy and clear definitions 
of terms!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>1.1.0 - Wishlist (roadmap and bug fixes on the horizon)!</h3>
Now this readme can be used to track issues I'm aware of and lay out future steps for expansion! Plus, the "base layer" matter searches can now be used to filter by open 
matters specifically, which massively cuts down on execution time for GetAllRecordsAsync()
and FastFetch()!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h2>1.0.0 - Publish to Live Environment!</h2>
Now the CalliAPICORE Project is live, so anyone in Amourgis & Associates can use it to compile reports and generate data! Tons of time saved and a whole bunch of redundant work 
made obsolete!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>CalliAPI Prerelease</strong></summary>
<h3>0.2.0 - Added Patch Log and Reporting! Plus, FastFetch!</h3>
This is exciting - now we have the FastFetch to grab all the records after a certain date AND a GetAllRecordsAsync() "Classic" GET.
FastFetch parallelizes the queries we send to Clio in order to grab up to 10,000 records lightning quick!
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>v0.1.0 - Added Serilog for logging!</h3>
<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #feb47b, #ff7e5f); margin: 20px 0;">

<h3>v0 - Add MatterFilters to allow for easy, natural-language filtering!</h3>
